Applied Statistical Methods: Statistical comparison of Book vs News Article
----------------

• Compared the information from the book and from the article. 

• Compared the diﬀerences such as words in each sentence for book vs article; word length for book vs article. 

• Applied appropriate statistical procedures (descriptive statistics, conﬁdence intervals, hypothesis tests, etc.). 

• Included appropriate ﬁgures (such as histograms and boxplots) to assess and illustrate any diﬀerences in ﬁndings. 

• When performing conﬁdence intervals / hypothesis tests, checks were made to make sure that assumptions were met.
